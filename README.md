# mushroom-classification
- In this project, we will examine the data and create a machine learning algorithm that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.
- The dataset used in this project is "mushrooms.csv" which contains 8124 instances of mushrooms with 23 features like cap-shape, cap-surface, cap-color, bruises, odor, etc. and is made available by UCI Machine Learning.
- Used machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting
- Deploy model using Flask
